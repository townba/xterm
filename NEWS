                            Patch #363 - 2020/12/26

     * disable groff hyphenation in generated html when using man2html.
     * change SCS “&4” Cyrillic to non-NRCS, per VT520 manual.
     * amend  fix  for  SCS  in  patch  #198  to  remove  DEL  rather than
       converting it to a space (report by Thomas Wolff).
     * modify  state transitions for selecting character sets to eliminate
       an ambiguity between the “A” used in VT220 versus VT320.
     * improve error recovery when selecting characters by resetting to US
       ASCII  when  no suitable encoding is found, e.g., attempting to use
       an NRCS sequence when NRCS is not enabled.
     * turn  off  hyphenation  in “.txt” conversion, prompted by groff
       changes.
     * add VT5xx ISO Latin-2 (prompted by discussion with Thomas Wolff).
     * amend  change  from  patch  #361  to  event-handling in CopyWait to
       handle active-icon as a special case (Debian #975687).
     * add  call to loadColorTable to get the visual information needed to
       decode BE RGBA32 color format (patch by Leandro Lupori).
     * modify the resource-parsing for disallowedPasteControls and similar
       lists of names/numbers to recognize “~;” (tilde) for cancelling a
       given name/number.
     * add ENQ, EOT and NUL to default for disallowedPasteControls.
     * change   default   for  disallowedPasteControls  to  omit  the  tab
       character (suggested by Harald Dunkel).
     * fix  swapped  height/width  in  regisScreenSize  and maxGraphicSize
       resources  using  "auto"  value,  from  patch #314 (report by Anton
       Lavrentiev)
     * revise  patch  #362 change for shift-modifier versus mouse protocol
       and  select/paste  by  adding  resource  shiftEscape,  which can be
       enabled  via  a  control  sequence  (prompted  by  discussion  with
       Matthijs van Duin).
     * simplify/improve  ifdef  in  trace code for using a separate set of
       files for each run of xterm.
     * add options -r and -t to vttests/query-color.pl to show the 6-digit
       RGB code and actual colors.
     * add nel to xterm-basic terminfo.
     * alter  vttests/modify-keys.pl  to  omit HTML reference links to the
       modified-keys table where no keycode was available.
