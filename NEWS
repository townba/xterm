                            Patch #350 - 2019/11/02

     * modify html/svg dump to not ignore zero'd/blank cells.
     * align terminfo file with ncurses, e.g., add xterm+osc104 block.
     * improve  discussion  of  modifyOtherKeys  in  manual  page  and  in
       ctlseqs.ms.
     * add vttests/modify-keys.pl script to illustrate the modifyOtherKeys
       resource (prompted by discussion with Bram Moolenaar).
     * various improvements to ctlseqs.ms, as part of autogenerating links
       for the website.
     * update  manual  page  default  for saveLines resource default value
       (Branden Robinson, Debian #913815).
     * add  command-line  option  -report-xres  to  show the values of the
       VT100 widget X resources when initialization is complete.
     * add   a   control   sequence  which,  like  tcap-query,  allows  an
       application  to  inspect  most  X  resource  settings  of the VT100
       widget.
     * adjust   some  optional  features  to  enable  them  in  the  imake
       configuration as they would be by default via the configure script.
     * add null-pointer checks to improve error recovery when bitmap fonts
       are missing or corrupt (report by Jonne Ransijn).
     * correct  the condition for deleting the EWMH window-title property,
       i.e., if UTF-8 titles are disabled, rather than if an update to the
       EWHM property found no change (report by Sven Joachim).
     * build-fix  for  the  case  when  configure  --enable-trace  is used
       without --enable-warnings (report by Sven Joachim).
     * fix a few minor bugs found with Coverity.
     * add  a check in property_to_string to avoid translating UTF8_STRING
       or  COMPOUND_TEXT into Latin-1 when UTF-8 encoding is active, e.g.,
       when  pushing onto the title-stack while switching to the alternate
       screen.
     * build-fix for the --disable-doublechars configure option (report by
       Brian Lindholm).
