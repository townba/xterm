                            Patch #347 - 2019/06/30

     * fix a few minor bugs found with Coverity.
     * improve  double-buffering  for  scrollbars  combined  with scrolled
       text;  add  bufferedFPS  resource  to  control  the maximum rate of
       screen updates (report by Mike Thornburg).
     * improve fixes for DECCRA handling of double-width characters (patch
       by Martin Hostettler).
     * improve  discussion  of  ECMA-48's  typographical  error  for SD in
       ctlseqs.ms (prompted by report by Martin Hostettler).
     * correct  off-by-one  in parameter limit-check for DECCRA (report by
       Martin Hostettler).
     * modify  saveCellData to handle case where double-width character is
       partially copied; that should be blanked (report/testcase by Thomas
       Wolff).
     * add  resource  buffered to allow enabling/disabling double-buffered
       mode.
     * two   fixes   for  the  double-buffer  configuration,  prompted  by
       MacPorts'  switch  to  double-buffering  (patch  by Mike Thornburg,
       MacPorts #58313):
          + ensure  that  the  needSwap flag is set after drawing TrueType
            text
          + corrected the drawable-parameter used for the bar-cursor
     * modify  ScrnRefresh to ignore a case where the left/right halves of
       a   double-width   character  have  been  set  to  different  video
       attributes.   The   attribute   to   use   is   in   the  left-half
       (report/testcase by Thomas Wolff).
     * correct a limit-check for DECCRA in case the target lies off-screen
       (report/testcase by Thomas Wolff).
     * documentation errata (report by Thomas Wolff).
     * reset flags including wraparound and reverse-wrap when switching to
       VT52 mode, while noting that DEC's standard documention leaves that
       behavior undefined (report by Thomas Wolff).
     * ensure  that  italic font is turned off on hard/soft resets (report
       by Martin Hostettler).
     * improve  responsiveness  to  X  events while processing HTML or SVG
       dumps (report by Martin Hostettler).
     * replace  logic  in  wcwidth.c for detecting double-width characters
       with  binary-search table generated using updated uniset (report by
       Robert Ross).
     * add  test-driver for wcwidth.c to simplify comparison with system's
       wcwidth.
     * ensure  that  window-manager name comparisons work when active-icon
       is  enabled,  since  CSI13t  uses  the  window-manager  name  (Arch
       #62818).
     * trim  a  stray  “experimental” in one of the comments about the
       tcap-query  feature,  which has been a supported feature since 2008
       (see patch #238).
