                            Patch #362 - 2020/11/11

     * cleanup of calls to free, removing checks for null (Walter Harms).
     * improved   mouse-button  reporting  (prompted  by  discussion  with
       Stephane Chazelas)
          + narrow  the scope of the change for shift-key in patch #361 to
            make it apply only when the modifyOtherKeys resource is set to
            2 (i.e., “program mode”). Also, when checking the shift-key,
            ignore modifiers other than shift, control and “meta”
          + use    the   alt/meta   modifier   information   obtained   in
            VTInitModifiers  to  replace  a hard-coded mod1 used to detect
            “Meta” for mouse-button responses.
     * reduce SIGWINCH's sent to the client by filtering out duplicates.
     * improve display when scaleHeight is greater than 1:
          + the  text-cursor  is  vertically-centered on the current line,
            rather  than  only extending below the current line (report by
            Manu Chaturvedi).
          + the  built-in  line-drawing  characters  extend  to the scaled
            cell-height.
     * fill-in  special  case  for  motion-events to match the changes for
       shift-key in pointer-button events from patch #361.
