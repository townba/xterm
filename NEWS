                            Patch #352 - 2020/01/16

     * adjust  fontsize  data  to handle a minor inconsistency from recent
       Xft  versions  (Debian  #880407,  adapted  from  patch  by  Vincent
       Lefevre).
     * add  a  table  to  the  manual page description of forceBoxChars to
       alert   the   reader   to   the   special   characters  aside  from
       “line-drawing” which are drawn directly when this resource is set
       (Debian #931305).
     * improve  checkXft  logic  which  attempts  to  detect  fonts  whose
       max-advance-width is inconsistent with the actual glyph widths. For
       some   fonts,  it  is  necessary  to  check  additional  characters
       (report/analysis by Jan Engelhardt).
     * improve  configure-checks  for  X  headers  and libraries on recent
       MacOS, which has moved those files under /usr/X11.
     * improve  portability  of  iconify/deiconify  feature by taking into
       account   some   window   managers   which   manipulate   the  EWMH
       _NET_WM_STATE property, adding/removing _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN rather
       than  actually  minimizing  the window (prompted by discussion with
       Jörg Breitbart).
     * improve  workaround  from  patch  #287  for the -iconic option when
       configured  with  toolbar  by  postponing  the  extra  request  for
       minimizing the window to the end of menu-initialization.
     * modify   xevents   special-case   for   mouse-events   to   include
       button-events   so  that  the  meta  key  by  itself  can  generate
       button-events (report/analysis by Mattias Engdegård).
     * amend  SGR-stack  change  from  patch  #348  to  not associate bold
       attribute with background color (report by Nicholas Marriott).
     * fix copy/paste error in manual page (patch by Larry Hynes).
     * add   definitions   in   xterm_io.h   so  that  GNU/Hurd  will  use
       posix_openpty (patch by Samuel Thibault).
     * build-fix in debug-tracing, for esctest.
     * updated autoconf macros
     * update config.guess
