                            Patch #349 - 2019/09/22

     * add  graphic  context  to  support  bold+italics  (patch  by  Quinn
       Strahl).
     * document window properties in the manual page.
     * improve title-string feature:
          + if  any of allowC1Printable, utf8Title or titleModes hint that
            an  application  might  send  a title-string encoded in UTF-8,
            check  if  that  is  the  case,  and  if  it is recodable into
            ISO-8859-1, use that for the ICCCM-style title.
          + check  if  the title given by a control sequence happens to be
            already  encoded  in  UTF-8, to avoid double-encoding (FreeBSD
            #240393).
          + Make sameName resource work for the EWMH titles.
          + Modify  menu-state of utf8Title to be consistent with the utf8
            source,  i.e.,  setting the EWMH properties automatically when
            UTF-8 is active.
     * reorganize  text-drawing  to  make it possible to investigate using
       Xft  to  implement VT100-style double-sized characters. While doing
       this,  made  a  workaround  for  apparent  Xft  bug which loses its
       drawable state when switching from 132 to 80 columns.
     * improve  font-warning  messages by showing which are derived rather
       than  directly  from resource settings (suggested by Tomas Korbar).
       Also filter repeated font-warning messages, to accommodate broken X
       configurations.
     * fix  an  inconsistency  between  failure  to load derived wide font
       versus  failure  to  load derived wide-bold font (Redhat #1679790).
       That relies upon the “:unscaled” property which is broken in some
       distributions  (however,  recent  Debian and the BSDs such as MacOS
       work).
     * updated  autoconf-252  to check X11R7 include/lib directories found
       on some older configurations.
     * set  a  graphic-context for border when double-buffering is active;
       to  prevent  the  border  color  from  changing  when  switching to
       reverse-video.
     * build-fix  for  --disable-ziconbeep,  which conflicted with the new
       double-buffer configuration (report by Brian Lindholm).
     * fix  loop-limit  for  lookup of fullscreen resource broken in xterm
       #347 (report by Scott Bertilson).
