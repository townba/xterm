                            Patch #336 - 2018/09/19

     * ensure  that only one of PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD is owned by xterm at
       a given time (Debian #901249).
     * documentation fixes (report by Lars Krueger):
          + document SL and SR.
          + document DECRPTUI, change number of digits to match VT420.
     * revise omitTranslation resource, e.g., splitting “default” into
       several more useful categories.
     * modify mask-logic to permit control- and meta- modifiers to be used
       in mouse protocol.
     * several   fixes   for  parsing/state  (report/testcases  by  Martin
       Hostettler):
          + remove  an  old/unimplemented entry for xterm-title from state
            table.
          + save/restore wrap-flag when scrolling, to fix an inconsistency
            between jump-scrolling and normal-scrolling.
          + improve  a  special  case  of wrapping where the cursor starts
            beyond   the   right-margin,   and  wraps  at  the  terminal's
            last-column before the settable-margins can take effect.
          + if  origin  mode  is  set,  adjust  a  restored  cursor column
            relative to the left margin.
          + when scrolling a line within left/right margins, correct order
            of the fixups needed when a double-width character crosses the
            margin boundary.
     * review/fix  a few cases where the parsing state was not reset after
       completing  a  control  sequence  (prompted  by  report  by  Martin
       Hostettler).
     * disallow  XTCHECKSUM  if the corresponding window-ops "SetChecksum"
       is unset.
     * add  print-vt-chars.pl  script to illustrate the NRCS and codepages
       supported by xterm.
     * add   other-sgr.sh   script  to  demonstrate  the  non-VT100  video
       attributes  implemented in patch #305, and added a summary of their
       introduction in ECMA-48 to the control sequences document.
     * add  tabs  and  -tabs  keywords  to  ttyModes  resource to simplify
       workaround  for  terminal  drivers  which  are  not  aware of UTF-8
       (FreeBSD #229682).
     * add VT5xx NRCS 7-bit Turkish and DEC Turkish.
     * add VT5xx NRCS 7-bit Hebrew and DEC Hebrew.
     * add VT5xx NRCS 7-bit Greek and DEC Greek.
     * correct  a  few  post-VT220  codepages to make them display without
       setting the NRCS state.
     * extend  vt100Graphics resource to include other character-sets such
       as the VT500 codepages in UTF-8 mode.
     * add   some   VT5xx   codepages  to  help  with  the  discussion  of
       96-character sets: ISO Greek Supplemental, ISO Hebrew Supplemental,
       ISO Latin–5 Supplemental, and ISO Latin–Cyrillic.
     * improve description of the VT300-controls for designating character
       sets,  and  fix  a  typo  which  indicated  that some were used for
       94-character sets (prompted by discussion with Lars Krueger).
     * add private control XTCHECKSUM for modifying checksumExtension.
     * factor  out  xterm's  DECRQCRA  checksum  extensions  as a resource
       setting checksumExtension.
     * revise   calculation  of  checksum  for  DECRQCRA  to  match  DEC's
       terminals (using screenshots of vttest provided by Markus Schmidt).
     * restore  a fix for memory-checksum setup of DECCKSR from patch #315
       incorrectly reverted in patch #334 as part of fix for DECRQCRA.
