                            Patch #348 - 2019/07/22

     * update  window-manager  hints  when  exiting  Tek4014  mode (Debian
       #932569, patch by Jonathan Irwin).
     * fix a misformatted printf in report-sgr.pl.
     * add    configure    check    for    termios   types,   to   improve
       compiler-warnings.
     * ensure  that  when  resetting  margins, to also reset DECLRMM. This
       affects  DECCOLM,  DECALN  (although  DEC  STD  070  mentions  only
       top/bottom margins), and DECSTR.
     * corrected  order  of  reset/move  when setting DECCOLM, and make it
       more  consistent by always resetting margins, rather than only when
       the mode is changed (report by James Holderness).
     * compile-in double-buffer support by default, changing the configure
       option  to  set  the default resource value for buffered to true or
       false.
     * take   in  account  the  reverse-video  state  when  computing  the
       filler-color  used  when  clearing  the  screen in double-buffering
       configuration.
     * correct   logic   for  filtering  scrollbar-updates  when  buffered
       resource is compiled-in but not enabled (report by Paul Lampert).
     * improve   state   saved/restored  for  cursor-save  and  SGR  stack
       features.
     * improve description of 1006 and 1005 mouse modes, to avoid implying
       that they use character-parameters (report by Bryan Christ).
     * explain  in  ctlseqs.ms  that  some of the numeric keypad keys were
       xterm   extensions   rather   than  VT100/VT220  terminal  features
       (prompted by discussion with Thomas Wolff).
     * explain  in ctlseqs.ms how the DEC windowing extension is supported
       by xterm.
     * add  28  rectangular  editing to the primary response (suggested by
       Thomas Wolff).
     * fix a typo, improve wording in ctlseqs.ms (Thomas Wolff).
     * fix internal column-parameter when SL or SR is used with left/right
       margins (patch by Thomas Wolff).
     * fix  off-by-one in VT52 graphics character mapping (patch by Thomas
       Wolff).
     * use  _X_UNUSED,  etc., when available as a fallback for GCC_UNUSED,
       etc., to reduce compiler warnings when building with imake.
     * update config.sub
